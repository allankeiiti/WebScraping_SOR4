# WebScraping_SOR4
Because of the Streets Of Rage 4/Bare Knuckle IV release on May 2 , this franchise being so nostalgic for me and I went to see how 
eb Scraping works I decided to make an 'small-project' that collect the HTML files from the MetaCritic User-Reviews page and have 
some fun with their reviews and make some data analysis using Python.
